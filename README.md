# American Sign Language (ASL)  Alphabet Recognition Model

## Project Overview
Welcome to the ASL Recognition Model! This project showcases my exploration into computer vision and deep learning, where I aimed to create a model capable of recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. The intention behind this project is to contribute to the accessibility of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

Throughout this project, I learned valuable skills in data collection, model training, and real-time video processing, and I found it to be a fulfilling experience that enhanced my understanding of machine learning principles.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
- **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV
- **Data Processing Library:** torchvision
- **Machine Learning Library:** scikit-learn
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab

## Data Collection
The project began with gathering data, which included:
- **Static ASL Letters:** A curated dataset of images representing the ASL alphabet served as the foundation for training the model.
- **Dynamic Gesture Videos:** I created a custom dataset for the dynamic gestures 'J' and 'Z'. This was crucial for improving the model’s understanding of motion and context.

To make the dataset more robust, I applied various data augmentation techniques to increase diversity and combat overfitting.

## Model Architecture
The backbone of the model is **ResNet18**, a well-regarded architecture in image recognition tasks. By leveraging transfer learning, I utilized a pre-trained version of ResNet18 to save time and computational resources. 

### Key Features:
- **Final Layer Adjustment:** I fine-tuned the final layer to accommodate my ASL classes, which includes 29 different categories representing letters A-Z as well as special gestures like SPACE, DELETE, and NOTHING.

## Training Process
- **Training Duration:** I started with a limited number of epochs for initial testing but plan to extend this to improve performance in future iterations.
- **Loss Function:** Cross-Entropy Loss was selected for its effectiveness in multi-class classification.
- **Optimizer:** I chose the Adam optimizer for its efficient learning rate handling.
- **Custom Data Loader:** I designed a custom data loader that can handle both static images and video data seamlessly, which was essential for training.

## Evaluation
The model was evaluated using both static image datasets and dynamic gesture video datasets. I used accuracy metrics to measure performance and performed error analysis, especially focusing on tricky letters like 'J' and 'Z', which involve motion and were harder for the model to classify correctly.

## Real-time Testing
To test the model’s capabilities in real-world scenarios, I developed a script that processes pre-recorded videos. During testing, predictions are displayed in real-time with an overlay that indicates the recognized letter and its confidence score. Observing the model in action was incredibly rewarding.

## Future Improvements
While I am pleased with what I have built, I recognize that there is always room for growth. Here are some areas I plan to focus on:
- **Bug Fixes:** Certain letters, particularly 'J' and 'Z', are misclassified. I have documented these issues and plan to address them in upcoming iterations.
- **Data Expansion:** Gathering more diverse samples will be essential for improving recognition accuracy.
- **Model Fine-tuning:** I will continue to experiment with hyperparameters and additional training epochs to further enhance performance.

## Lessons Learned
This project has provided numerous learning opportunities:
- **Data Diversity is Key:** The quality and variety of data significantly impact model performance.
- **Hands-on Experience:** I gained practical skills in using OpenCV for video processing and PyTorch for deep learning.
- **Problem Solving:** Navigating the challenges of gesture recognition has reinforced the importance of persistence in the field of machine learning.
